# BatteryTestDataAnalysis

The current version of this program calculates stats for all batteries in the dataset

The executable Python file is stats.py. The rest are supporting files with supporting functions.

Running the program:

    1) In your computer's terminal change the directory to the project directory with the command cd PATH 
    (e.g. cd /Users/omid/Desktop/BatteryDataAnalysis)

    2)Then Run the program with ./stats.py in your Terminal

    3) A browse window will appear in which you can choose the test data file you want

The Project Directory already has a sample excel, FP2_Test_Data. This sample's data is not actual data and was altered. It only serves to show what sample input would look like.

The Program will output an Excel File named stats.xlsx into the Project Directory

All .py files should be kept together in the same directory. The program relies on the structure of the Excel being the same as the sample Excel in this directory (it can have more entries, just in the same structure).
